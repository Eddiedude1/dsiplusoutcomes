#  Defining Your Non-Negotiables + Application Strategy + Cover Letters

## Learning Objectives:

* Understand what actually makes you happy in your career

* Communicate what you are looking for in your career to future employers

* Have a way to decide if an organization is a good fit for you

* Know when to negotiate and talk money in the interview process

* Practicing negotiation

## Framing: (5/5)

What is a must-have in your next career? How do you narrow down your job search strategy? What is the must-have versus nice-to-have? Being able to communicate WHY you want a job is just as important as why you are a good fit for a job. We will tackle these questions and more this week. Be ready with your Organizational Research for a deep dive. 

Negotiating can be hard and intimidating. No matter how many times you have negotiated, how much money you have, or if you are an employer or job seeker - we are all weird about money! We’ll give you the tools and practice today to make this process less intimidating for you.

## You do:

- Pull out a piece of paper or new document on your computer

- Think about the last 5 roles you have had. If you recently graduated think of volunteer roles you’ve had, roles in clubs, sports teams, or membership organizations.

- On the left hand side of the page right out all of the things you liked about each of those roles

- On the right hand side of the page list out all of the things that you didn’t like about the roles

**Think about: **

- Team structure - did you work alone or part of a team? Or both?

- Structure of the work environment - was it flexible? Bureaucratic? Creative? Lively? Quiet?

- Culture - was it fun? Serious? Creative? Supportive? Smart? Mission driven?

- Management style

- Commute

- Dress code

- Physical environment

- Salary

- Professional development and growth

- . . . and anything else!

Now, take a step back and look for any over-arching themes - what do you see?

## We do:

Open discussion

## You do:

Next, write down your core values professionally and personally. Don’t think too much about this, just what first comes into your head, and this will be a list that continues to grow. Some ideas:

* Integrity

* Authenticity

* Growth

* Kindness

* Peace

* Courage

* Adventure

* Generosity

* Making the world a better place

* Joy/play

* Creativity

What connections do you see between your values and your likes/dislikes?

## We do:

Open discussion

## You do:

Now look at your list of likes/dislikes and choose your 3 non-negotiables. The 3 things that you know if they aren’t there you won’t be able to be successful or happy.

## Application Strategies

## Cover Letters 
Don't stress out about Cover Letters. This is another tool to gain insight into who you are as a candidate that should be an addition to your resume to demonstrate why you would be a great addition to their team.  

Use the KISS method-Keep It Simple Stupid. 

Format: 

Use the same heading as your resume {Name, phone number, email, location (just city, state), link to portfolio}

Paragraph 1: Say what you are applying for and how you heard about the organization. 

Paragraph 2: State why THEY are great. 

Paragraph 3: State why YOU are great. 

Paragraph 4: State why you BOTH are great and would be a good fit. 

Paragraph 5: Call to Action and Contact Info.
