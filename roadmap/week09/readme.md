# Qualification Check In + Post Course Expectations 

## Learning Objectives:

* Go over outcomes events post graduation

* Learn how to best set yourself up for success in your job search 

* Walk through all of your final materials with your local coach

## Framing:

We know you are in the final sprint for your projects. All we need is 20 minutes of your time! We’ll all come together to go over all things outcomes post-course, and then meet with each of you for 10-15 minutes to check-in on your outcomes materials.

## Final Material Expectations:
We expect your Resume, Cover Letter, LinkedIn, and GA Profile to be final at this point, but understand if you are still working on adding your final project to your Portfolio. Remember that your portfolio must be complete within one week of graduation to receive support from Outcomes. 

**Due next Monday by 7 PM:**
