# Outcomes Homework

- Homework will follow the exact same requirements and format as your in-class homework. You will always have competing pressure to complete outcomes work or your classwork. Manage your time effectively and use allocated outcomes work time wisely! 

- Turn in **something**. Turning in an incomplete assignment is **infinitely** better than turning in nothing at all. We can't get you the help you need unless we see what you're working on. That said...

- **Late homework will not be accepted**. If you have issues submitting homework please let us know.

## Due Dates and Grading

- You will be assigned homework every week. Outcomes HW is due every Monday at 7 pm, and you can see each week's assignment in your class calendar. 

- You will receive feedback on *some* of your homework assignments. Each homework details if you will receive feedback and when. We will always check that it's completed. If you have any questions about your work or want additional feedback, please come by office hours or set up a 1:1 with us. 

- **We rely on homework to know where you're at.** It's very much to your advantage to turn in your homework the day it's assigned, even if -- *especially* if -- you're not able to finish it. Then we can address concerns and keep you from falling behind. We provide this flexibility to account for extenuating circumstances.
